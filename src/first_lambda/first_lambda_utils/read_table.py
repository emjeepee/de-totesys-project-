    This function:
         1) makes a dictionary that contains 
            those rows of a table in the ToteSys 
            database that have been updated. The 
            dictionary's sole key is the name 
            of the table. The value of the key is
            a list of dictionaries, each of which
            represents an updated row and 
            contains key-value pairs, each pair 
            showing '<columnName>': '<cellValue>'.    
         2) makes the dictionary above by getting
            i) updated rows from the table in the 
            form of a list of lists, each member 
            list containing cell values only for 
            an updated row (ie no column names)
            ii) the column names for the table in the
            form of a list of lists. Each member list
            contains a string for the name of a column.
         3) uses the two lists of lists in i) and ii)
            above to create the dictionary mentioned 
            in 1) above.

    Args:
         1) table_name: the name of the table.
         2) conn: an instance of a pg8000:native 
          Connection object.
         3) after_time: a time stamp of the form
          "2025-06-04T08:28:12". If the ToteSys
          database has changed a row of the table
          after this time, this function 
          considers the row updated. 
          On the very first run of this handler 
          after_time has a value that represents 
          1January1900. On subsequent runs its 
          value represents the time of the 
          previous run of the first lambda 
          handler.
          

    Returns:
         the dictionary this function creates, which
         looks like this: {
                    "sales_order": [
                        {"Name": "xx", "Month": "January", "Value": 123.45, etc}, <-- one updated row
                        {"Name": "yy", "Month": "January", "Value": 223.45, etc}, <-- one updated row
                        {"Name": "zz", "Month": "January", "Value": 323.45, etc}, <-- one updated row
                                        etc
                                         ] 
                        },
        where "sales_order" is the table 
        name and keys "Name", "Month", 
        "Value", etc are the table's 
        column names. The values of 
        those keys are the row-cell 
        values.
