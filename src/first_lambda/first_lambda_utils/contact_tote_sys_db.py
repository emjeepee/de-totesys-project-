    This function:
        Makes an SQL query to the ToteSys
         database, the nature of which 
         depends on the value of opt.
    
    Args:
        1) conn_obj: an instance of the 
         pg8000.native Connection class.        
        2) opt: an int the value of which 
         determines which SQL query this 
         function makes to the ToteSys
         database.
         when opt is 1 the query string
          is to get updated rows.
         when opt is 2 the query string
          is to get column names.
        3) after_time: a time stamp that will 
          always be the time of the last run 
          of the first lambda function. 
        4) table_name: the name of the 
         table that this function wants
         to ask the ToteSys database 
         about.
        
    Returns:
        The result of the SQL query this
        function made to the ToteSys database.
