    """
    This function:
        Creates a list of dictionaries that 
         represents the date dimension table. This list is 
         the date dimension table. The first 
         member dictionary has key date_id,
         whose value is datetime object 
         start_date. Subsequent member 
         dictionaries have their date_id values
         that increment by one day, ie 
         start_date + 1 day, start_date + 2 days, 
         start_date + 3 days, etc.

    Args:
        start_date: a datetime object for the date from 
         which the date dimension table must begin. 

        loop_range: a number of days from loop_date.
         Also the number of dictionaries that will
         populate the list that represents the date 
         dimension table (ie the number of rows).

    Returns:
        A date dimension table. This list of dictionaries 
        looks like this:
        [ {"date_id": start_date, "year": 2020, "month": 07, "day": 2 ... etc},
          {"date_id": -start_date+1day-, "year": 2020, "month": 07, "day": 3 ... etc},
          {"date_id": -start_date+2days-, "year": 2020, "month": 07, "day": 4 ... etc},
          etc 
        ], 
        For example, assuming start_date is a datetime object representing 
        the date 2jul2020. If loop_range is 5000 there will be
        5000 member dictionaries in the list
