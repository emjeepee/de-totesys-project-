    This function:
        1) has the overall task of 
            i) reading Parquet files in the processed 
            bucket that were put there at a time 
            indicated by the latest time stamp 
            string held in the ingestion bucket, 
            ii) creating SQL query strings that will 
            insert updated table data into tables in 
            the data warehouse (all the rows of a 
            table will be inserted, some or all of
            the rows of a table having been updated),
            iii) connecting to the warehouse,
            iv) making the SQL queries actually  
            put those data in the warehouse and
            v) closing the connection to the warehouse

        2) integrates the following utility functions
            to carry out its task:
                get_parquet_files()
                make_SQL_queries_to_warehouse()
