# This folder is used in dev only 
# (it's the folder in which the 
# project installs dependencies 
# and the project zips it so that 
# in dev the project can use 
# terraform to provision cloud 
# infrastructure). the 
# .github/workflow/workflow.yml 
# file will make GitHub Actions
# create this folder anew and 
# install dependencies in it:
layer/

# The workflow.yml file makes the 
# GHA runner generate the 
# requirements/*requirements.txt 
# files from the 
# requirements/*requirements.in 
# files, so no need to upload them
# to the remote repository: 
requirements/layer-requirements.txt
requirements/requirements.txt
