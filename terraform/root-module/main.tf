# WHAT NEEDS TO BE PROVISIONED:
# =============================
# IN THE CHILD MODULE:
# --------------------
# 1) A lambda function
# 2) An execution role for the lambda 
#    function
# 3) a standalone policy to attach to the 
#    lambda execution role to let a lambda 
#    write to a bucket  
# 4) a policy attachment for the policy in 3)
# 5) a standalone policy to attach to the 
#    lambda execution role to let a lambda 
#    read from a bucket   
# 6) a policy attachment for the policy in 5)
# 7) an inline resource-based policy to allow
#    a lambda to be triggered by an event 
#    from a bucket
# 8) an s3 bucket with inline policy that
#    allows it to send events to a lambda
#    (will be either ingestion bucket and
#    policy to send events to transform 
#    lambda or processed bucket and policy to 
#    send events to load lambda).
# 9) A CloudWatch Metric Filter that looks 
#    for "Error" in the Lambda logs.
#    A CloudWatch Alarm that fires if that 
#    filter detects some number of errors
#    over some time period.
# 10) An SNS Topic with an email subscription 
#    so that the project sends alerts.
# 11) asdasd asdasaasd asd asd sad sd
#    asdasd asdasaasd asd asd sad sd.


# IN THE ROOT MODULE (ie here):
# -----------------------------
# 1) The provider
# 2) The EvenBridge Scheduler to trigger
#    the extract lambda at some frequency.
#    Also: an IAM execution role for the 
#    Scheduler, a policy for it and a
#    policy attachment.
# 2) The lambda permission to allow the
#    extract lambda to be invoked by 
#    EventBridge Scheduler.
# 2) the backend bucket (to hold the 
#    state file)
# 3) an s3 bucket to store the zipped lambda 
#    handlers and the zipped layer
# 4) A policy that allows the code S3 bucket 
#    to be read by the AWS Lambda service (so
#    that the SERVICE (not the lambda 
#    function) can get the zipped handler and
#    layer files.
# 5) the loading of a zipped lambda handler code
# 6) the loading of the zipped layer file
# 7) the lambda layer version
# 8) in turn (via invocations of the module):
#    a) the extract lambda, lambda exec role,
#       role policy for writing to ingestion 
#       bucket, attachment for that policy,
#       ingestion bucket
#    b) the transform lambda, lambda exec role,
#       role policy for reading from ingestion
#       bucket, attachment for that policy,
#       policy to write to processed bucket, 
#       attachment for that policy, processed 
#       bucket
#    c) the load lambda, policy to read from 
#       processed bucket
